<p>Candy Haley was held on Rikers for three years in solitary confinement before having all charges dropped in court. Standing outside the Board of Corrections she described the torture she endured from abusive guards to a lack of hygiene supplies available, “you need sanitary napkins. Imagine an officer denied you sanitary napkins and you're bleeding on yourself without that's inhumane.” </p>

	
<p> <a href="https://www.womenscja.org/">The Women's Community Justice Association</a> represents the women held at Rikers Island in the Rose M. Singer center. Michelle Feldman, the policy director for WCJA believes the City can do more to reduce the prison population A few months ago it was found that 82% of the women at Rikers received mental health treatment compared to 49% of men. And up to 93% are domestic violence survivors." East Harlem, East New York, Brownsville and the South Bronx are the highest zip codes for admissions to Rose M. Singer Center. With the construction of the new borough based jails the only women's facility New York City will be located in Kew Gardens, Queens will not bring those detained closer to their families.</p>
