<p>Candy Haley was held on Rikers for three years in solitary confinement before having all charges dropped in court. Standing outside the Board of Corrections she described the torture she endured from abusive guards to a lack of hygiene supplies available, “you need sanitary napkins. Imagine an officer denied you sanitary napkins and you're bleeding on yourself without that's Inhumane.” There are over 3,900 New Yorkers incarcerated in the City. The individuals incarcerated are disproportionately people of color who cannot afford bail. Rikers island, the city's largest jail, is planned to close by 2027. The people incarcerated on Rikers will be moved to borough based jails currently under construction.</p>

<p>Mayor Adams and the city administration support the transition stating “Being closer to home and transit will enhance the network of support systems for people who are detained and help prevent reincarceration.” The borough based jails will be located at 125 White street in lower Manhattan, 275 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, 126-02 82nd Ave in Queens and 75 east 141st street in the South Bronx.</p>

<p>The Women's Community Justice Association represents the women held at Rikers Island in the Rose M. Singer center. According to the WCJA Seventy percent of the women incarcerated are the primary caregivers for their families. Michelle Feldman, the policy director for WCJA,  addressed the prison administration: “East Harlem, East New York, Brownsville and other parts of the South Bronx are the highest zip codes for admissions to Rosies over the past five years.” The women's facility in Kew Gardens, Queens will not bring those detained closer to their families.</p>

<p>Rose M. Singer center on Rikers island is a microcasm of what is happening across the United States. The incarceration of women and girls is 5X more than in 1980 with now more than a million women under the supervision of DOC. The Department of Corrections spends on average $500,000 to incarcerate one person a year.</p>
