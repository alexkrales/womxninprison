<p>Candy Haley was held on Rikers for three years in solitary confinement before having all charges dropped in court. Standing outside the Board of Corrections she described the torture she endured from abusive guards to a lack of hygiene supplies available, “you need sanitary napkins. Imagine an officer denied you sanitary napkins and you're bleeding on yourself without that's Inhumane.” Women's Community Justice Association has organized the #beyondRosies campaign with 374 cosigners so far. Their citywide petition asks Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul to provide safety and justice for the women and gender expansive people at Rosies.</p>

<p>According to the WCJA 93% of women at Rikers are survivors of domestic violence. Seventy percent of the women incarcerating are the primary caregivers for their families. Michelle Feldman, the policy director for WCJA, addressed the prison administration: “Please let more mothers, daughters and sisters spend the holidays where they belong.” </p>

<p>Officials have pledged to improve prison conditions. Last year, Governor Hochul announced that women and gender expansive people would be moved to “safer” state facilities. The majority of women at Rosies are pre-trial though for months they were moved temporarily to Bedford high security prison upstate. Now the population of Rosie’s has doubled 325 womxn with no improvement in conditions.</p>

<p>Rose M. Singer center on Rikers island is a microcasm of what is happening across the United States. The incarceration of women and girls is 5X more than in 1980 with now more than a million women under the supervision of DOC. The Department of Corrections spends on average $500,000 to incarcerate one person a year.</p>
